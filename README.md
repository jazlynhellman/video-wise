# video-wise
Design prototype for an empathy forward video conferencing app for elderly individuals.

# About
This is the prototype for an HCI term project. The prototype can be viewed in full on Framer [here](https://framer.com/share/HCI-SeniorityRules--fdAZXlsUB2xx3LVe5InI/fuZKrZXQC).

This is a video conferencing application for elderly individuals that seeks to maximize empathetic connections throught an audio sentiment analysis component when a video feed is not possible. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing was especially important for the elderly populations who were at risk. But video conferencing tools, like Zoom, Google Meet, Facetime, and more are not easy to use for many elderly people. This prototype emphasizes principles of usability and learnability, going through many rounds of iterative human-centered design, to propose a simple solution for our target population of eldery people who exhibit a desire to learn new technologies to stay connected during the pandemic but get easily stumped when doing so. My personal contributions included creating the design, organizing and conducting user interviews, defining the target population and personas, usability testing, contributing to the React prototype based on my designs, and writing the term reports.

# Usability Goals
1. Users of the tool should be able to adopt it without any required technical background.
2. Emotions should be shown seamlessly by the tool when they are required.
3. Emotions should be understandable to the user.
4. Users should feel a sense of connection, community, or family by using the system.
5. The system should not require the use of a dedicated device (the system should be able to run on any type of device as long as there is at least a microphone).

# Usability Heursitics
The following were identified as the most critical heursitics to achieve in the design. Several are taken from Nielson's sources and are attributed as such:

1. Error prevention (Nielson's Heuristics)
    - We wish to deter users from causing errors to occur in the system. Given that we worry that our target demographic will not be able to fix problems if they occur in certain cases, we plan to reduce the number of possible things that can go wrong for the user.
2. Aesthetic and minimalist design (Nielson's Heuristics)
    - We believe that it is imperative to ensure that the UI provided to our user base is as streamlined as possible to ensure that they don't confuse different actions. As such, we intend to use a particularly minimalist design.
3. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors (Nielson's Heuristics)
    - We believe that it is imperative that users understand when something has gone wrong and we also think that in general, it should be fixed by itself because our target audience may have a more limited ability to troubleshoot.
4. Help and documentation (Nielson's Heuristics)
    - We intend to provide clear and well laid out help for each of the actions a user can be taken. We feel it is a real possibility that users will take a few tries to remember how to perform actions so we want to clearly lay them out in our help section which will appear on each page.
5. Few features beyond absolute necesities
    - We feel that including too many options to the system will have an inverse effect in that users will not be able to use any of them due to confusion. As such, we intend to only include those which are absolutely necesary.
6. Clearly describable
    - We believe that it is important that users be able to explain problems to troubleshooters. As such, icons should be clear and describable -  especially when errors arise - to allow troubleshooters to help fix problems.
